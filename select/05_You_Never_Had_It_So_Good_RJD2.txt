I wanna give, you the full regalia
No stone unturned to please this woman
So can you keep, the buzzin to yourself
Cause when it starts mr nice guy's done

Now I don't mind your mother's talk.
Maybe I should.
I really need your men to stop.
You never had it so good.

Now she can get plump off a beer and meatloaf.
Lost a tooth, but kept a nice grin.
Bought two pairs of shoes just for one weekend.

Now I don't mind your mother's talk.
Maybe I should.
I really need your men to stop.
You never had it so good.

We grew up quick, we get drunk quick.
We grew up quick, we get drunk quick.
We got smart shoes quick so let's slow down.
We can't afford to live alone.

Now I don't mind your mother's talk.
Maybe I should.
I really need your men to stop.
You never had it so good.
