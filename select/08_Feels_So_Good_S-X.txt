Open your mind for me
Who would you like to be?
Do you wanna ride with me?
I know you do

Still I can't get enough of it
And you know you're loving it
And I would never love another bitch quite like you
Oh, you gotta put trust in me
Don't ever worry 'bout another bitch, no
She would never get what you would get, I got you

Oh, baby
You know I mean it
You know I'm crazy for it
You know you are the one I'm looking for
Oh, I should've save it, baby
But you make me wanna spend it all on you

'Cause it feel so good with you, baby, oh
It feel so good with you
Feel so good, oh
Yeah, it feel so good with you, baby, oh
Feel so good with you
Feel so good, oh

Whoa!
Stop right there
Tell me what you looking for
You don't know
Do you need something more?
Do you remember what you came here for?
I know you don't
I know you more than you know you

Oh, baby
It's so amazin'
You couldn't make it up
You know you are the one I'm looking for
I know you need it, baby
'Cause you naked and my hands are all on you

And it feel so good with you, baby, oh
It feel so good with you
Feel so good, oh
Yeah, it feel so good with you, baby, oh
Feel so good with you
Feel so good, oh

And it feel so good with you, baby, oh

Feel so good, oh

Feel so good with you (you, baby)
Feel so good, oh
