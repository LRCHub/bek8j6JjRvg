I got a letter, come to me by mail
My baby's comin' home
I hope that she don't fail
You know I feel so good
Well, I feel so good
You know I feel so good
I feel like ballin' the jack

I'm goin' down to the station
Just to meet a train
My baby's comin' home
You know I've got dead aim

You know I feel so good
Yeah, I feel so good
You know I feel so good
I feel like ballin' the jack

I feel so good
I hope I always will
I feel like a Jack out with a Jenny
Well behind the hill

You know I feel so good
Well, I feel so good
You know I feel so good
I feel like ballin' the jack

I feel so good
I hope I always will
I feel like a Jack out with a Jenny
Well behind the hill

You know I feel so good
Well, I feel so good
You know I feel so good
I feel like ballin' the jack
