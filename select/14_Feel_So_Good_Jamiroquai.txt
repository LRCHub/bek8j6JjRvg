All flights for the Moon, Mars, Jupiter
And the outer galaxies
Of Alpha Centauri
Shuttle departs, 2.56 seconds
Feels good
I'm stranded on a spaceship hideaway
And something makes me think I'm here to stay
I'm so happy where I am
Feels good
I've journeyed to the other atmosphere
And every breath I take just makes it clear
I'm holding heaven in my hands
It's automatic baby and it feels good
And it feels so good
Feels good
And it feels so good
Feels good
These extra-sensory sensations
Are causing me some complications
Electrostatic information
Feels good
I'm playing with a pleasure trafficker
Arriving soon intergalactica
I'm holding heaven in my hands
It's automatic baby and it feels good
Feels good
Feels good
Feels good
Feels good
And it feels so good
Feels good
And it feels so good
Feels good
And it feels so good
Feels good
And it feels so good
Feels good
Feels so good, yeah
Feels so good
Feels so good, good
Feels good
Feels so good, yeah
Feels so good
Feels so good, good
Feels good, I'm stranded on a spaceship hideaway
